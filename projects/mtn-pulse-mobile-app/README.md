## 🚧 Challenges and Solutions
- **Challenge**: **Managing High Traffic Volumes**
  - **Solution**: Scaled the backend using load balancers and optimized API calls to reduce latency during peak hours. Used caching strategies to enhance response time for frequently accessed endpoints.
  
- **Challenge**: **Real-Time Notification Delivery**
  - **Solution**: Integrated Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) for seamless push notifications. Implemented rate limiting to prevent spam and ensure efficient delivery without overloading the system.
  
- **Challenge**: **Ensuring Security and Compliance**

   - Integrates with the backend via secure API calls.

2. **Backend (Node.js + Express)**:
   - Handles API requests, processes business logic, and interacts with MTN’s core services.
   - Implements caching, error handling, and rate limiting for optimal performance.
   - Manages integration with MTN’s payment gateways and third-party services.

3. **Database (MongoDB)**:
   - Stores user profiles, purchase history, and app preferences.
   - Indexed for fast data retrieval to handle large volumes of user activity.

4. **Notification System (Firebase Cloud Messaging)**:
   - Sends real-time notifications to users about promotions, account updates, and service alerts.
   - Rate limiting and logging to monitor message delivery and effectiveness.

5. **Cloud Infrastructure (Google Cloud)**:
   - Ensures scalable compute and storage resources.
   - Supports containerized deployments using Docker and enables CI/CD with Jenkins for continuous integration.
